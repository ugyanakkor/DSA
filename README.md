To run these files you will need node and typescript on your computer  

node: `https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager`  

typescript:
`npm install -g typescript`

you have to transpile the typescript file into a js file to be able to run:
`tsc <example_file.ts>`

then run the generated js file with node: `node <example_file.js>`
